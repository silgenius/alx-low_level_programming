# ALX Low-Level Programming - Preprocessor

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x0D-preprocessor" directory. Each project explores the concept of macros and preprocessing in C programming.

## Files

1. **0-object_like_macro.h:** Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

2. **1-pi.h:** Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

3. **2-main.c:** A simple C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

4. **3-function_like_macro.h:** Header file that contains function-like macros to compute the absolute value of a number and to find the larger of two numbers.

5. **4-sum.h:** Header file that contains a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To run any of the programs, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
