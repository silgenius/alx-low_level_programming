# ALX Low-Level Programming - Recursion

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x08-recursion" directory. Each project explores the concept of recursion in programming.

## Projects

1. **0-puts_recursion:** A recursive function that prints a string, followed by a newline.

2. **1-print_rev_recursion:** A recursive function that prints a string in reverse.

3. **2-strlen_recursion:** A recursive function that returns the length of a string.

4. **3-factorial:** A recursive function that returns the factorial of a given number.

5. **4-pow_recursion:** A recursive function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

6. **5-sqrt_recursion:** A recursive function that calculates the natural square root of a number.

7. **6-is_prime_number:** A recursive function that checks if a number is a prime number.

8. **7-is_palindrome:** A recursive function that checks if a string is a palindrome.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To run any of the programs, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
