# ALX Low-Level Programming - Function Pointers

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x0F-function_pointers" directory. Each project explores the concept of function pointers in programming.

## Projects

1. **0-print_name.c:** A program that prints a name using a function pointer.
   
2. **1-array_iterator.c:** A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
   
3. **2-int_index.c:** A function that searches for an integer in an array.

4. **3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h:** A calculator program that performs simple operations.

5. **100-main_opcodes.c:** A program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To run any of the programs, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
