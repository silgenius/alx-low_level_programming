# ALX SE Programme Low-Level Programming Projects

Welcome to the ALX SE Programme's low-level programming project repository. This repository is a comprehensive resource to help you learn and practice foundational programming concepts using the C language. This repository contains my solutions to various low-level programming projects from ALX School. Each folder represents a different topic and contains projects related to that topic.

## Topics and Projects

- **0x00-hello_world:** Introduction to C programming with basic "Hello, World!" programs.

- **0x01-variables_if_else_while:** Exploring variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while, for).

- **0x02-functions_nested_loops:** Introduction to functions and nested loops in C.

- **0x03-debugging:** Learning about debugging techniques and fixing code errors.

- **0x04-more_functions_nested_loops:** More practice with functions and nested loops.

- **0x05-pointers_arrays_strings:** Introduction to pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

- **0x06-pointers_arrays_strings:** More practice with pointers, arrays, and strings.

- **0x07-pointers_arrays_strings:** Advanced exercises involving pointers, arrays, and strings.

- **0x08-recursion:** Projects exploring the concept of recursion in programming.

- **0x09-static_libraries:** Creating and using static libraries in C.

- **0x0A-argc_argv:** Projects involving command line arguments in C.

- **0x0B-malloc_free:** Dynamic memory allocation and freeing memory in C.

- **0x0C-more_malloc_free:** Further practice with dynamic memory allocation.

- **0x0D-preprocessor:** Learning about the C preprocessor and how it works.

- **0x0E-structures_typedef:** Introduction to structures and typedef in C.

- **0x0F-function_pointers:** Understanding and using function pointers in C.

- **0x10-variadic_functions:** Projects involving variadic functions in C.

- **0x12-singly_linked_lists:** Exploring the concept of singly linked list in C

- **0x13-more_singly_linked_lists:** Deep dive into singly linked list in C.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects within each topic folder. Each project comes with its own set of instructions and challenges to complete. You can use these projects as learning resources, references, or examples of how to solve specific programming problems.
