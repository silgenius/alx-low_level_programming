## Projects

1. [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c)
   - Function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.

2. [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c)
   - Function that prints the binary representation of a number.

3. [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c)
   - Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

4. [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c)
   - Function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.

5. [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c)
   - Function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.

6. [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c)
   - Function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

## Usage

To use these functions, you will need to compile them along with your own program. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-main.c 0-binary_to_uint.c -o my_program
