# ALX Low-Level Programming - Structures and Typedef

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x0E-structures_typedef" directory. Each project explores the concept of structures and typedef in C programming.

## Files

1. **dog.h:** Header file that defines a new type `struct dog` with elements `name`, `age`, and `owner`.

2. **1-init_dog.c:** C program that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.

3. **2-print_dog.c:** C program that prints a `struct dog`.

4. **4-new_dog.c:** C program that creates a new `struct dog`.

5. **5-free_dog.c:** C program that frees the memory allocated for a `struct dog`.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To run any of the programs, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
