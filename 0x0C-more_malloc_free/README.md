# ALX Low-Level Programming - More Malloc and Free

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x0C-more_malloc_free" directory. This set of projects delves deeper into dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C.

## Projects

1. **0-malloc_checked:** A function that allocates memory using `malloc`. If `malloc` fails, the function causes the program to exit with a status value of 98.

2. **1-string_nconcat:** A function that concatenates two strings. It will use at most `n` bytes from the second string, and `n` can be greater or equal to the length of the second string.

3. **2-calloc:** A function that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`. The memory is initialized to zero.

4. **3-array_range:** A function that creates an array of integers, starting from `min` to `max` (inclusive).

5. **100-realloc:** A custom implementation of the `realloc` function, which reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`.

6. **101-mul:** A program that multiplies two positive numbers.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To run any of the programs, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
