# ALX Low-Level Programming - Malloc and Free

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x0B-malloc_free" directory. These projects explore dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and memory deallocation using `free`.

## Projects

1. **0-create_array.c:** A function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.

2. **1-strdup.c:** A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, containing a copy of a given string.

3. **2-str_concat.c:** A function that concatenates two strings.

4. **3-alloc_grid.c:** A function that returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers.

5. **4-free_grid.c:** A function that frees a 2D grid previously created by the `3-alloc_grid.c` function.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To use any of the functions, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
