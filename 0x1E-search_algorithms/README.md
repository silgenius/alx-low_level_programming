# 0x1E. Search Algorithms

## Description

Welcome to the 0x1E. Search Algorithms project repository! This project is focused on understanding and implementing various search algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental for solving problems related to searching data efficiently. By the end of this project, you will have implemented several classic search algorithms and gained a deeper understanding of their time and space complexities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of searching algorithms.
- Differentiate between various searching algorithms.
- Implement search algorithms in C.
- Analyze the time and space complexities of search algorithms.

## Project Files

- **0-linear.c**: Implementation of the Linear Search algorithm.
- **1-binary.c**: Implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.
- **2-O**: Time complexity analysis of the linear search algorithm.
- **3-O**: Time complexity analysis of the binary search algorithm.
- **4-O**: Time complexity analysis of an advanced search algorithm.
- **5-O**: Time complexity analysis of a complex search algorithm.
- **6-O**: Time complexity analysis of another search algorithm.

## How to Use

To compile and run any of the provided search algorithm implementations, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your machine (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the C file you want to compile.
4. Compile the C file using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -o output_name source_file.c
   ```
Replace `output_name` with the desired name for the compiled program and `source_file.c` with the name of the C source file.

5. Run the compiled program:
	```bash
	./output_name
	```

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to compile and run the search algorithms:

- Compile and run the Linear Search algorithm:
	```bash
	gcc -o linear_search 0-linear.c
	./linear_search
	```

- Compile and run the Binary Search algorithm:

	```bash
	gcc -o binary_search 1-binary.c
	./binary_search
	```
