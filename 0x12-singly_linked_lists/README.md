# 0x12 Singly Linked Lists

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x12-singly_linked_lists" directory. Each project focuses on implementing and working with singly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Projects

1. **0-print_list.c:** A function that prints all the elements of a linked list.
2. **1-list_len.c:** A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.
3. **2-add_node.c:** A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
4. **3-add_node_end.c:** A function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
5. **4-free_list.c:** A function that frees a linked list.
6. **100-first.c:** A function that prints a message before the `main` function is executed.
7. **101-hello_holberton.asm:** An assembly program that prints "Hello, Holberton".

## Usage
