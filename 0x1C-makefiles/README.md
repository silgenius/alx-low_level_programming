# 0x1C. Makefiles

## Description

Welcome to the 0x1C. Makefiles project repository! This project focuses on the creation and use of Makefiles, which are a tool used to automate the build process of software projects. Makefiles help manage project dependencies, compile source code, and streamline the build process, making it easier to build and maintain complex projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of a Makefile.
- Write Makefiles to automate the build process of C programs.
- Use common Makefile directives and variables.
- Manage dependencies and rules in a Makefile.
- Utilize implicit rules and macros to simplify Makefiles.
- Create and use custom rules and targets.

## Project Files

- **0-Makefile**: A simple Makefile that compiles a single C file.
- **1-Makefile**: Makefile that introduces the `CC` and `SRC` variables.
- **2-Makefile**: Makefile that includes the `OBJ` and `NAME` variables.
- **3-Makefile**: Makefile that introduces the `RM` variable and the `clean` target.
- **4-Makefile**: Makefile that includes the `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re` targets.
- **5-island_perimeter.py**: Python script to calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid.
- **5-Makefile**: Makefile that includes the `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`, and `phony` targets.
- **100-Makefile**: Advanced Makefile that includes the `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`, `phony` targets, and uses pattern rules.

## How to Use

To use the provided Makefiles, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Makefile.
2. Run the `make` command followed by the target you want to build or execute.
