# ALX SE Program - Low-Level Programming Project


## Project: 0x01-variables_if_else_while

Welcome to the `0x01-variables_if_else_while` project folder of the ALX SE Low-Level Programming curriculum. This project focuses on introducing you to the basics of C programming, including variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while).

## Project Tasks

This project folder contains several C source code files, each addressing specific tasks. Here's an overview of the tasks:

1. **0-positive_or_negative.c:** This program determines if a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **1-last_digit.c:** This program prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and checks if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.

3. **2-print_alphabet.c:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a loop.

4. **3-print_alphabets.c:** This program prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using loops.

5. **4-print_alphabt.c:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding 'q' and 'e'.

6. **5-print_numbers.c:** This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10.

7. **6-print_numberz.c:** This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only the putchar function.

8. **7-print_tebahpla.c:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

9. **8-print_base16.c:** This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

## Getting Started
