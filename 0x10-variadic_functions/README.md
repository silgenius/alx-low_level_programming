# ALX Low-Level Programming - Variadic Functions

This repository contains my solutions to the ALX School low-level programming projects in the "0x10-variadic_functions" directory. Each project focuses on using variadic functions in C.

## Projects

1. **0-sum_them_all.c:** A function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

2. **1-print_numbers.c:** A function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

3. **2-print_strings.c:** A function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

4. **3-print_all.c:** A function that prints anything.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or resource for your own learning. To run any of the programs, follow the provided instructions in each project's directory.
